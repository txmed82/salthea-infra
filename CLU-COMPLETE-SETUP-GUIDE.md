# üß† Complete CLU Setup Guide

## ‚úÖ Infrastructure Ready

Your Azure Language Service is deployed and configured:

- **Endpoint**: `https://salthea-language.cognitiveservices.azure.com/`
- **Region**: East US (CLU supported)
- **API Key**: Stored in Key Vault as `CLUKey`
- **Project Name**: `salthea-intent-routing` (stored as `CLUProjectName`)
- **Deployment**: `production` (stored as `CLUDeploymentName`)

## üéØ Manual CLU Project Setup

Since the REST API approach failed, follow these steps in Language Studio:

### Step 1: Open Language Studio
1. Go to **https://language.cognitive.microsoft.com/**
2. Sign in with your Azure account 
3. Make sure you're in the correct subscription/tenant

### Step 2: Create CLU Project
1. Click **"Conversational Language Understanding"**
2. Click **"Create new project"**
3. Fill in project details:
   - **Project Name**: `salthea-intent-routing`
   - **Text Primary Language**: `English (en-us)`
   - **Description**: `Intent classification for Salthea health chat routing`
   - **Enable multiple languages**: `No`

### Step 3: Connect Azure Resource
1. Select your **Language resource**: `salthea-language`
2. This should auto-detect your East US resource
3. Click **"Next"** ‚Üí **"Create project"**

### Step 4: Add Intents
Add these 5 intents with their descriptions:

#### Intent: `search_medical`

```

#### Intent: `conversation`
**Description**: General conversation, greetings, thanks, social interaction
**Examples**:
```

Perfect, thank you
That makes sense
I understand now
Okay, got it
Awesome

```

#### Intent: `system_query`
**Description**: Account, subscription, connection, or system-related requests
**Examples**:
```
Connect my health data
Show my account status

How do I connect my data?
What's my account information?
Can you access my health records?
How do I sync my data?
What data do you have access to?
Show me my connection status
How do I link my EHR?
What health apps can I connect?
How do I grant data access?
Check my data connections
```

### Step 5: Train the Model
1. Click **"Training jobs"** in the left menu
2. Click **"Start a training job"**
3. **Training mode**: `Standard training`
4. **Model name**: `salthea-routing-model`
5. Click **"Train"**
6. ‚è≥ **Wait 5-10 minutes** for training to complete

### Step 6: Deploy the Model
1. Go to **"Deploying a model"** 
2. Click **"Add deployment"**
3. **Deployment name**: `production` 
4. **Model**: Select your trained `salthea-routing-model`
5. Click **"Deploy"**
6. ‚è≥ **Wait 2-3 minutes** for deployment

### Step 7: Test the Deployment
1. Go to **"Testing deployments"**
2. Select **Deployment**: `production`
3. Test with sample queries:
   - `"What causes diabetes?"` ‚Üí Should predict `search_medical` 
   - `"Analyze my health trends"` ‚Üí Should predict `memory_personal`
   - `"Suggest health questions"` ‚Üí Should predict `meta_request`
   - `"Hello"` ‚Üí Should predict `conversation`

## üîß Backend Integration

### Environment Variables Already Configured
Your backend is already configured to use these Key Vault secrets:
- `CLU_ENDPOINT` ‚Üí `CLUEndpoint`
- `CLU_KEY` ‚Üí `CLUKey` 
- `CLU_PROJECT_NAME` ‚Üí `CLUProjectName`
- `CLU_DEPLOYMENT_NAME` ‚Üí `CLUDeploymentName`

### Code Status
- ‚úÖ **azureIntentService.js**: Ready to use CLU
- ‚úÖ **chatRoutes.js**: Integrated with CLU routing
- ‚úÖ **Fallback system**: Enhanced heuristics as backup
- ‚úÖ **Test script**: `test-clu-routing.js` available

## üöÄ Verification

### Test CLU Integration
Once your CLU model is deployed, run:
```bash
cd salthea-backend
node test-clu-routing.js
```

You should see output like:
```
üß† CLU Routing:
  Intent: search_medical (87% confidence)
  Reasoning: High confidence medical question  
  shouldUseValyu: true
```

### Check Application Logs
Monitor your application logs for:
- `‚úÖ Azure Intent Service initialized` 
- `üß† Classifying intent with Azure CLU`
- `üéØ CLU Result: search_medical (87% confidence)`

## üéØ Expected Performance Impact

### Before CLU
- ‚ùå "Suggest questions" triggered Valyu (slow)
- ‚ùå Some false positives in routing
- ‚ö° ~3-5 second response times

### After CLU  
- ‚úÖ "Suggest questions" stays in direct chat (fast)
- ‚úÖ More accurate intent detection
- ‚ö° ~1-2 second response times for non-search queries

## üîç Troubleshooting

### If CLU Fails
- System automatically falls back to enhanced heuristics
- Check logs for `üîÑ CLU not configured, falling back to heuristics`
- Verify Key Vault secrets are accessible

### Common Issues
1. **Training fails**: Make sure you have 10+ examples per intent
2. **Low accuracy**: Add more diverse training examples
3. **Wrong predictions**: Review and retrain with corrected examples

## üìã Training Data
Complete training examples are available in `clu-training-data.json` for reference.
